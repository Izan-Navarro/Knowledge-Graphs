Any technological tool enabling rapid screening of the COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be crucially helpful to the healthcare professionals. The main clinical tool currently in use for the diagnosis of COVID-19 is the Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is expensive, less-sensitive and requires specialized medical personnel. X-ray imaging is an easily accessible tool that can be an excellent alternative in the COVID-19 diagnosis. This research was taken to investigate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The aim of this paper is to propose a robust technique for automatic detection of COVID-19 pneumonia from digital chest X-ray images applying pre-trained deep-learning algorithms while maximizing the detection accuracy. A public database was created by the authors combining several public databases and also by collecting images from recently published articles. The database contains a mixture of 423 COVID-19, 1485 viral pneumonia, and 1579 normal chest X-ray images. Transfer learning technique was used with the help of image augmentation to train and validate several pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The networks were trained to classify two different schemes: i) normal and COVID-19 pneumonia; ii) normal, viral and COVID-19 pneumonia with and without image augmentation. The classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity for both the schemes were 99.7%, 99.7%, 99.7% and 99.55% and 97.9%, 97.95%, 97.9%, and 98.8%, respectively. The high accuracy of this computer-aided diagnostic tool can significantly improve the speed and accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis. This would be extremely useful in this pandemic where disease burden and need for preventive measures are at odds with available resources.","This work was made possible by NPRP12S-0227-190164 from the Qatar National Research Fund, a member of Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar.

With the recent advent of whole slide digital scanners, tissue histopathology slides can now be digitized and stored in digital image form. Consequently, digitized tissue histopathology has now become amenable to the application of computerized image analysis and machine learning techniques. Analogous to the role of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) algorithms in medical imaging to complement the opinion of a radiologist, CAD algorithms have begun to be developed for disease detection, diagnosis, and prognosis prediction to complement the opinion of the pathologist. In this paper, we review the recent state of the art CAD technology for digitized histopathology.

paper25.xml,IHC Profiler: An Open Source Plugin for the Quantitative Evaluation and Automated Scoring of Immunohistochemistry Images of Human Tissue Samples,Frency Varghese;Amirali B Bukhari;Renu Malhotra;Abhijit De,"Molecular Functional Imaging Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, India;Health Canada and University of Ottawa, Canada",Canada;India,"In anatomic pathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC) serves as a diagnostic and prognostic method for identification of disease markers in tissue samples that directly influences classification and grading the disease, influencing patient management. However, till today over most of the world, pathological analysis of tissue samples remained a timeconsuming and subjective procedure, wherein the intensity of antibody staining is manually judged and thus scoring decision is directly influenced by visual bias. This instigated us to design a simple method of automated digital IHC image analysis algorithm for an unbiased, quantitative assessment of antibody staining intensity in tissue sections. As a first step, we adopted the spectral deconvolution method of DAB/hematoxylin color spectra by using optimized optical density vectors of the color deconvolution plugin for proper separation of the DAB color spectra. Then the DAB stained image is displayed in a new window wherein it undergoes pixel-by-pixel analysis, and displays the full profile along with its scoring decision. Based on the mathematical formula conceptualized, the algorithm is thoroughly tested by analyzing scores assigned to thousands (n = 1703) of DAB stained IHC images including sample images taken from human protein atlas web resource. The IHC Profiler plugin developed is compatible with the open resource digital image analysis software, ImageJ, which creates a pixel-by-pixel analysis profile of a digital IHC image and further assigns a score in a four tier system. A comparison study between manual pathological analysis and IHC Profiler resolved in a match of 88.6% (P,0.0001, CI = 95%). This new tool developed for clinical histopathological sample analysis can be adopted globally for scoring most protein targets where the marker protein expression is of cytoplasmic and/or nuclear type.

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS-the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases-make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.","We thank our colleagues in the Medical and Population Genetics and Cancer Informatics programs at the Broad Institute, who have encouraged and supported us during the development the Genome Analysis Toolkit and have been such enthusiastic early adopters, in particular, Gad Getz, Anthony Philippakis, and Paul de Bakker.

Here, we develop a deep learning algorithm that can accurately detect breast cancer on screening mammograms using an ""end-to-end"" training approach that efficiently leverages training datasets with either complete clinical annotation or only the cancer status (label) of the whole image. in this approach, lesion annotations are required only in the initial training stage, and subsequent stages require only image-level labels, eliminating the reliance on rarely available lesion annotations. our all convolutional network method for classifying screening mammograms attained excellent performance in comparison with previous methods. On an independent test set of digitized film mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM), the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.88, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.91 (sensitivity: 86.1%, specificity: 80.1%). On an independent test set of full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images from the INbreast database, the best single model achieved a per-image AUC of 0.95, and four-model averaging improved the AUC to 0.98 (sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity: 96.1%). We also demonstrate that a whole image classifier trained using our endto-end approach on the CBIS-DDSM digitized film mammograms can be transferred to INbreast FFDM images using only a subset of the INbreast data for fine-tuning and without further reliance on the availability of lesion annotations. These findings show that automatic deep learning methods can be readily trained to attain high accuracy on heterogeneous mammography platforms, and hold tremendous promise for improving clinical tools to reduce false positive and false negative screening mammography results.

Despite the new performance highs, the recent advanced segmentation models still require large, representative, and high quality annotated datasets. However, rarely do we have a perfect training dataset, particularly in the field of medical imaging, where data and annotations are both expensive to acquire. Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions. We hope this survey article increases the community awareness of the techniques that are available to handle imperfect medical image segmentation datasets.",,"February 13, 2020",10.1038/s41591-019-0508-1,W2956228567,,,C105339364;C41008148;C108583219;C154945302;C534262118;C2779974597;C2780192828;C2778755073;C119857082;C142724271;C19527891;C121608353;C71924100;C58640448;C512399662;C126322002;C111919701;C205649164,Software deployment;Computer science;Deep learning;Artificial intelligence;Medical diagnosis;Clinical Practice;Prostate cancer;Scale (ratio);Machine learning;Pathology;Medical physics;Cancer;Medicine;Cartography;Family medicine;Internal medicine;Operating system;Geography,1924,,,,-1,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010287;10.1109/TMI.2015.2476509;10.1002/hbm.10062;10.1093/jnci/djy222;10.1109/RBME.2009.2034865;10.1038/s41598-019-48995-4;10.1155/2022/3351256;10.1109/CBMS49503.2020.00111,,

paper7.xml,Fitting Linear Mixed-Effects Models Using lme4,Douglas Bates;Martin M├ñchler;Benjamin M Bolker;Steven C Walker,University of Wisconsin-Madison;ETH Zurich;McMaster University;McMaster University,,"Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed-and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.","Rune Haubo Christensen, Henrik Singmann, Fabian Scheipl, Vincent Dorie, and Bin Dai contributed ideas and code to the current version of lme4; the large community of lme4 users has exercised the software, discovered bugs, and made many useful suggestions. S├©ren H├©jsgaard participated in useful discussions and Xi Xia and Christian Zingg exercised the code and reported problems.

paper8.xml,Deep Learning Model of Image Classification Using Machine Learning,Qing Lv;Suzhen Zhang;Yuechun Wang,"Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College, China;Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College, China;Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College, China",China,"Not only were traditional arti cial neural networks and machine learning di cult to meet the processing needs of massive images in feature extraction and model training but also they had low e ciency and low classi cation accuracy when they were applied to image classi cation. erefore, this paper proposed a deep learning model of image classi cation, which aimed to provide foundation and support for image classi cation and recognition of large datasets. Firstly, based on the analysis of the basic theory of neural network, this paper expounded the di erent types of convolution neural network and the basic process of its application in image classi cation. Secondly, based on the existing convolution neural network model, the noise reduction and parameter adjustment were carried out in the feature extraction process, and an image classi cation depth learning model was proposed based on the improved convolution neural network structure. Finally, the structure of the deep learning model was optimized to improve the classi cation e ciency and accuracy of the model. In order to verify the e ectiveness of the deep learning model proposed in this paper in image classi cation, the relationship between the accuracy of several common network models in image classi cation and the number of iterations was compared through experiments. e results showed that the model proposed in this paper was better than other models in classi cation accuracy. At the same time, the classi cation accuracy of the deep learning model before and after optimization was compared and analyzed by using the training set and test set. e results showed that the accuracy of image classi cation had been greatly improved after the model proposed in this paper had been optimized to a certain extent.",+is work was supported by the Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College.,19 July 2022,10.1155/2022/3351256,W4286218307,,,C154945302;C41008148;C108583219;C153180895;C50644808;C75294576;C52622490;C81363708;C119857082;C45347329;C2776401178;C115961682;C98045186;C41895202;C138885662;C111919701,Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Deep learning;Pattern recognition (psychology);Artificial neural network;Contextual image classification;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural network;Machine learning;Convolution (computer science);Feature (linguistics);Image (mathematics);Process (computing);Linguistics;Philosophy;Operating system,39,https://ror.org/04j808v60,Research Institute of Posts and Telecommunications,Slovakia,-1,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3010287;10.1155/2022/1172405;10.4114/intartif.vol23iss66pp124-137;10.1155/2022/7796681;10.1155/2021/5631685;10.1109/TMI.2015.2476509;10.1109/RBME.2009.2034865;10.1371/journal.pone.0096801;10.1038/s41598-019-48995-4;10.1038/s41591-019-0508-1;10.1109/CBMS49503.2020.00111,,Shijiazhuang Posts and Telecommunications Technical College
paper9.xml,DoubleU-Net: A Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Medical Image Segmentation,Debesh Jha;Michael A Riegler;Dag Johansen;P├Ñl Halvorsen;H├Ñvard D Johansen;Simulamet;Norway,"UiT The, Arctic University of Norway, Norway;UiT The, Arctic University of Norway, Norway;Oslo Metropolitan University, Norway;UiT The, Arctic University of Norway, Norway",Norway,"Semantic image segmentation is the process of labeling each pixel of an image with its corresponding class. An encoder-decoder based approach, like U-Net and its variants, is a popular strategy for solving medical image segmentation tasks. To improve the performance of U-Net on various segmentation tasks, we propose a novel architecture called DoubleU-Net, which is a combination of two U-Net architectures stacked on top of each other. The first U-Net uses a pre-trained VGG-19 as the encoder, which has already learned features from ImageNet and can be transferred to another task easily. To capture more semantic information efficiently, we added another U-Net at the bottom. We also adopt Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to capture contextual information within the network. We have evaluated DoubleU-Net using four medical segmentation datasets, covering various imaging modalities such as colonoscopy, dermoscopy, and microscopy. Experiments on the 2015 MICCAI sub-challenge on automatic polyp detection dataset, the CVC-ClinicDB, the 2018 Data Science Bowl challenge, and the Lesion boundary segmentation datasets demonstrate that the DoubleU-Net outperforms U-Net and the baseline models. Moreover, DoubleU-Net produces more accurate segmentation masks, especially in the case of the CVC-ClinicDB and 2015 MICCAI sub-challenge on automatic polyp detection dataset, which have challenging images such as smaller and flat polyps. These results show the improvement over the existing U-Net model. The encouraging results, produced on various medical image segmentation datasets, show that DoubleU-Net can be used as a strong baseline for both medical image segmentation and cross-dataset evaluation testing to measure the generalizability of Deep Learning (DL) models.","This work is funded in part by Research Council of Norway project number 263248 (Privaton).
